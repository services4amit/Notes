Installation/Configuration of ELK and Filebeat

 Beats(Data collection) -> logstash(Data aggregation and processing) -> elasticsearch(Indexing and storage) -> Kibana(Analysis and visualization)

Elasticsearch:
STEP 1: Download: https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch

STEP 2: Once downloaded, open the command prompt and change the directory bin folder of Elasticsearch and execute the below command Elasticsearch service
Run bin/elasticsearch (or bin\elasticsearch.bat on Windows)
Ex:    C:\elastic_stack\elasticsearch-7.8.0\bin>elasticsearch.bat
STEP 3: Point your browser at http://localhost:9200 to check if Elasticsearch service has started

Kibana:
STEP 1: Download: https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana
STEP 2:
a.	Open config/kibana.yml in an editor
b.	Set elasticsearch.hosts to point at your Elasticsearch instance
Ex:
# The URLs of the Elasticsearch instances to use for all your queries.
elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]

STEP 3: Once downloaded, open the command prompt and change the directory bin folder of Kibana and execute the below command to start Kibana service
Run bin/kibana (or bin\kibana.bat on Windows)
STEP 4: Point your browser at http://localhost:5601  to check if Kibana service has started

Logstash:
STEP 1: Download and unzip Logstash: https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash
STEP 2: Prepare Logstash.conf file
STEP 3: Run the following command in command prompt  bin>logstash -f logstash.conf
**Logstash conf file creation steps below**

Filebeat:
STEP1: Download and unzip Filebeat
STEP2: Edit the filebeat.yml configuration file
If you want to use Logstash to perform additional processing on the data collected by Filebeat, you need to configure Filebeat to use Logstash.
1.	Change enabled to true
2.	Paths: give the path of the folder that should be crawled and fetched 
filebeat.inputs:

# Each - is an input. Most options can be set at the input level, so
# you can use different inputs for various configurations.
# Below are the input specific configurations.

- type: log

  # Change to true to enable this input configuration.
  enabled: true

  # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
  paths:
    - C:\Users\testing\logs\*
    #- c:\programdata\elasticsearch\logs\*

3.	disable the Elasticsearch output by commenting it out and enable the Logstash output by uncommenting the logstash section:

#----------------------------- Logstash output --------------------------------
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["localhost:5044"] 

STEP3: To test your configuration file, change to the directory where the Filebeat binary is installed, and run Filebeat
Bin>filebeat -e -c filebeat.yml


Logstash.conf:
Create a file named "logstash.conf" and save it in the same directory as Logstash.
Logstash.conf

input { stdin { } }
output {
  elasticsearch { 
	hosts => ["localhost:9200"] 
	index => “mytestindex”
	}
  stdout { codec => rubydebug }
}
